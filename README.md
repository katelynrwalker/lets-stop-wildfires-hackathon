# Let's Stop Wildfires Hackathon

I am working on the **let's stop wildfires hackathon**. You can find more information on this hackathon in the official [repo]( https://github.com/aiformankind/lets-stop-wildfires-hackathon).

I built a few notebooks in google colab. Feel free to use it, comment it or improve it! :heart:

## :one: First challenge
The first task is to build a classifier to separate images with smoke and images without smoke.

:point_right: For the moment, I have around 0.142857 error_rate using a simple resnet30 after a lot of epochs.

## :two: Second challenge
The second task is almost the same: to build a classifier to separate images with smoke and images without smoke. Images are pieces of the images used in the first challenge.

:point_right: The classifier is faster to train. After a few epochs, the error_rate is around 0.066207.
