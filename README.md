# Let's Stop Wildfires Hackathon

I am working on the **let's stop wildfires hackathon**. You can find more information on this hackathon in the official [repo]( https://github.com/aiformankind/lets-stop-wildfires-hackathon).

I built a few notebooks in google colab. Feel free to use it, comment it or improve it! :heart:

## :one: First challenge
The first task is to build a classifier to separate images with smoke and images without smoke.

:point_right: For the moment, I have 0.120301 error_rate using a simple resnet30.
